# coverage-by-method.sh : what each verification method covers, alone
# Copyright (c) 2026 Jon Mayo - MIT-0 OR Public Domain
#
# An aggregate coverage number says how much of the interpreter the whole
# rig reaches. It does not say which method reached it, and it cannot say
# what any one method contributes that no other does. This runs each method
# on its own against the same instrumented build and records the set of
# lines it executed, which makes both questions answerable.
#
# Usage: ./coverage-by-method.sh [method ...]
#
# Methods: unit program apps archtest fuzz lockstep
# With no arguments it runs the ones whose prerequisites are present.
#
# The expensive ones need a reference model and a checkout:
#   archtest   qemu-system-riscv32 and ACT pointing at riscv-arch-test
#   fuzz       qemu-riscv32
#   lockstep   qemu-riscv32
#   apps       CM and LUA pointing at checkouts
