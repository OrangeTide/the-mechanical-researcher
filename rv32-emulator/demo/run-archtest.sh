# run-archtest.sh : build and run the riscv-arch-test suites for RV32IMAFC
# Copyright (c) 2026 Jon Mayo - MIT-0 OR Public Domain
#
# Each test is assembled against the target port in archtest/, executed on
# the emulator, and its signature region compared byte for byte against the
# same binary running on qemu-system-riscv32.
#
# Usage: ./run-archtest.sh <path-to-riscv-test-suite> [suite ...]
#
# The suite directory is the riscv-test-suite/ directory of a checkout of
# https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test on the old-framework-3.x
# branch. The current main branch needs a toolchain whose assembler pads
# .p2align with nops while relaxation is disabled; binutils 2.42 fills it
# with zeros instead, which makes those binaries hang on any model.
